Config files are supposed to be formatted as follows:

"name"
{
	S:stringExample=this is a string
	I:integerExample=123
	D:doubleExample=3.14
	B:booleanExample=(1+1==2)
};

"name 2" ...



To make a comment, use '#'
#This is a comment

Comments and blank lines can be placed anywhere. Opening and closing braces ('{' and '};')
should be given their own lines, to avoid potential errors. Each attribute must be given its
own line and must be a part of DIBS (Double, Integer, Boolean, String)
